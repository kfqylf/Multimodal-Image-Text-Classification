# Multimodal Image-Text Classification (Kaggle Competition)

This project addresses a multi-label classification task where both images and textual captions are used to make predictions.

## 🎯 Goal
- Use deep learning to extract and fuse visual and textual features
- Build a high-performance classifier for multi-label prediction

## 📦 Tools and Models
- Image model: Pretrained `ResNet50`
- Text model: Pretrained `BERT`
- Fusion: Multi-head attention mechanism
- Framework: Keras, TensorFlow, HuggingFace Transformers

## 🧪 Evaluation
- Metric: Mean F1-Score
- Achieved competitive score in Kaggle leaderboard
